Description: A miniature implementation of an ebay auction that uses Jinja2 as a frontend, and web.py and SQLite3 as a backend. This was a group project that was completed with two other people. Much of this code was handed to our group by our teacher, but our job was to utilize it in order to make the calls to the database. Our work also involved writing a little bit of Jinja and debugging/testing.

Note: It is necessary to have Jinja2, web.py, and SQLite3 installed in order for this to work. These libraries have been omitted to make git commits cleaner.
